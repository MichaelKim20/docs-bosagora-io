# Bosagora Nodes

## Agora

In Bosagora, the nodes comprise the blockchain which is called *Agora*. In early blockchains, like Bitcoin, the nodes are responsible for enforcing the consensus algorithm and storing the blocks and not much more. The nodes in Agora have other responsibilities and opportunities.

## Nodes and Validators

Anyone can run a full node in Agora. You do not need to make an investment in BOA to run a full node. Perhaps you just want to support the network. Or maybe you’ll want to participate more later on. There are no technical specs released yet for running a full node, but they will be announced around the time we’re ready to launch.

If you want to participate in Agora more than just running a full node, there are two ways to do that. The first is as a *validator*. You must run a full node in order to be a validator. Validators have the opportunity to partake in confirming blocks and validating Agora transactions. Validators have financial incentives to do so in the form of BOA rewards. There are two ways for validators to receive BOA rewards: confirmation rewards and transaction fees.

Confirmation rewards are given to a validator when they contribute to a block confirmation. Transaction fees are applied to all transactions and consist of a fixed transaction fee (i.e., it’s the same amount for all transactions) and a data fee which is proportional to the size of the transaction data (i.e., larger data transactions cost more).

To run a full node and receive an incentive as a validator, you must freeze some BOA. The frozen BOA function as a security deposit against an attempt to forge the blockchain. In other words, if a node tries to forge the blockchain, some of the frozen BOA will be confiscated and sent to the Commons Budget account.

Anyone who fulfills the following conditions can become a validator:

+ Freeze at least 40,000 BOA and forgo liquidity
+ Operate a full node at a stable network speed (operate in a server or personal computer)

The second way to participate in Agora is as a member of *The Congress Network*. Validators in Agora can join The Congress Network. The Congress Network, which follows the rule of one node-one vote, is a way for the nodes in the network to participate in democratic decision-making with regard to the evolution of the network. Members of The Congress Network also get to participate in the decision-making of how to provision the *Commons Budgets*. The Common Budget is a fund of BOA cryptocurrency which is used for system upgrades and any other proposal which benefits the entire Bosagora ecosystem.

The members of The Congress Network can set nodes in two directions depending on their goals:

+ Operating a greater number of nodes increases their voting power
+ Accumulating BOA in a single node reduces node operating costs

## Enrollment Process

Participants are called validators, while observers of the consensus protocol are called nodes. While every validator is a node, not every node is a validator. In order for a node to become a validator, and begin a validation cycle, it must complete the **enrollment process**. Once that node completes the enrollment process, it immediately becomes a validator, collecting and propagating transactions. When a node originally enrolls, it is not yet assigned a *quorum* set and is therefore expected to be passive (sign blocks only when they reach the 50% threshold) until the next *quorum balancing* event happens.
