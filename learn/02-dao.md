# DAO

A decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) is, in essence, computer code that is distributed on a blockchain. The computer code is written to automate organizational decisions and rules (including cryptocurrency transactions). The decisions and rules of the DAO are embedded in the code and execute automatically without human intervention. Both the rules and subsequent actions are recorded on the blockchain, which means everything is transparent and cannot be tampered with.

In Bosagora, The Congress Network is a DAO.

## The Congress Network

The Congress Network is the decision-making body for Bosagora comprised of fully-synchronized node operators. The Congress Network was created to enable effective and inclusive collaboration among the various project stakeholders to continuously enhance the Bosagora software and ecosystem. For example, decisions on a system upgrade can be made through proposal, review and voting within the Congress Network.

All node operators of Bosagora can join The Congress Network. The Congress Network adheres to the 1-node-to-1-vote rule. There are two subjects about which The Congress makes decisions: system upgrade proposals and how to spend the Commons Budget.

To ensure The Congress Network is inclusive and efficient, we will implement [Votera](https://www.voteranow.com/), an online decision making tool. Votera has the following characteristics:

+ Anonymity
+ Flexibility
+ Convenience
+ Archiving
+ Reporting

## Rewards

Members of The Congress Network can receive rewards (in BOA) for participating in the Congress. There are two ways for them to receive rewards: *confirmation rewards* and *transaction fees*.

**Confirmation Rewards**: Are given to a node when a block is confirmed. This reward is crucial in providing a financial incentive to operate a node. The quantity issued to a node is proportional to the quantity of frozen coins held in the node. The rewards are distributed to validators when a new block is created.

**Transaction Fees**: Congress Nodes receive 70% of collected transactions fees while 30% is sent to the Commons Budget. Transaction fees can be adjusted through The Congress Network.

## Commons Budget

The Commons Budget is BOA cryptocurrency set aside for developing the Bosagora ecosystem. The Commons Budget can be spent on BOA coin buy-backs, bounties, marketing campaigns, initial expenses for project/service upgrades and so on.

The Commons Budget is funded by BOA which is accumulated whenever a block is created and by 30% of transaction fees. The use of the Commons Budget is requested through a proposal to the Congress Network and approved by a vote of the Congress Network. If a proposal is approved by the Congress Network, the Commons Budget is transferred automatically according to the details of the proposal through a *Trust Contract*.
